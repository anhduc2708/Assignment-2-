<img src="nickprofile.jpg" width="200px">
<p><br>Nick, ID number is s3804825, My national is Vietnam. I can spoke 2 languages which are Vietnammese and Enghlish. I am a person who always be friendly. Black coffee wihtout sugar is my favorite drink.I have a special feeling with the ball that I can't describe how strong and special is it. Football is my life. I always find the ball and practice myself when I have freetime. I loved to "destoying my laptop" and also find new thing in technology world. That's my IT interest. I have some soft skills and knowledge in open and repair devices.</br></p>
<h3>Nick's industry data</h3>
<p>My job title is Web developer. My job title ranked 11th which counted from the below. My dream job required JAVA, Python, and Git. JAVA skill gets the highest rank in my job required. Python and Git are the important skills, but its ranks are low which are 4th and 5th counted from the below.  What is about genetic skill? Web developer requires lots of skills such as English, communication skill, problem solving and creativity. Their ranks are difference from each other. Communication skill has the 1st rank. The second rank is taken by problem solving skill. English is my lowest skill. Business Management, SAP, and Microsoft Window are IT skill that my job is not required but web developer need to understand and know little bit about those skills. Troubleshooting, Research, and Leadership are the three highest rank of genetic skills that web developer not required but they are good and important to make people become expert IT. </p>
<h3>Nick's IT Techonology</h3>
<p>In 4.0 era, there are many types of technology which work different from each other. There are Clouds, services, servers, Cybersecurity, Blockchain and cryptocurrencies, Machine Learning, Autonomous vehicles, Natural Language processing and chatterbots, Robots, and Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Makey Makeys, and other small computing devices. I have interested at Cloud, servers, Machine Learning, Autonomous vehicles, and Robots. Those four are main areas that I had seen and acknowledged it. People usually use their technology, but they never know the advance functions of their devices. There are many different function and benefit of that four areas. I am interested at Cloud servers the most in those four areas.
First, what is Cloud? What does it do? Cloud can basically understand as the servers that connected to internet and software and application could be leased as a part by Cloud through the Internet. Cloud server is the server that run virtual area by technology environment. It is functioned through cloud computing platform through the network, and it can be accessed remotely.  According to <a href="https://www.ijcsi.org/papers/IJCSI-9-1-1-201-207.pdf">https://www.ijcsi.org/papers/IJCSI-9-1-1-201-207.pdf</a>, it is the state-of-the-art implementations of cloud computing is presented. For examples, Google Drive and Apple iCloud are popular in cloud server area. Google and Apple company had done an excellent job. The users are getting comfortable in using cloud to store their personal things. In 4.0 era, technology is developing rapidly with non-stop ratio. New phones, devices, computers, laptops, and applications is updating every single day. According to J.Clement, the record is about more than 100 applications released in google play per month in 2020 and the previous year. By the record, people can know that cloud server area is developing in positive way. It gets closed to users, easy to use, and brings lots of benefits by its functions. There are two types of cloud computing such as Location of the cloud computing and Type of services offered. Location of cloud computing has four types of cloud. Public cloud is hosted by cloud vendor and the users had no visibility and control it. Private cloud can be hosted by the users and it is private. The other users can not access to difference cloud server.  Hybrid cloud can be understood basically as the comparison of public cloud and private cloud. Finally, Community cloud can be shared between organization in the same community. Nowadays, people are connecting everything and application with cloud server or computing. In near future, cloud servers will increase the storage capacity, update the performance of internet and improvement of cloud servers. The improvement of cloud servers will mostly depend on the development of technology and technology company. The simplest examples are yahoo, email, outlook. Yahoo is old style of cloud server. Email and outlook are the improvement of cloud servers. My prediction about cloud servers in cloud is people will access to cloud by their own voice and fingerprint. Nowadays, people access to cloud server by user’s name or email and password which is complicated and easy to forget the user’s name or email and password. Fingerprint and voice are more safety and easy to log in. In the current, some of smartphone and bank had allowed the user to log in by face id and fingerprint but it need to connect to the saved passwords on the devices. For example, I had to save my password to my phone so that I can use face id to log in to iCloud in the anytime I need. It is convenient but face id is not working well enough. My prediction is voice password will replace face id which is hard to copy and easy to identify.
What is Cloud server’s benefits? Cloud servers are individual which mean the other cloud serves cannot access or impact to your cloud servers without permission. Cloud is stability, safe, and high secure. It is fast and can avoided the hardware issue that impacted in physical. Adding memory and disk space is got easier by cloud servers. Users are affair about lying while they are doing online payment. Sometimes, the users will be lie by the seller. In cloud environment, users will pay for what they use monthly. There is one more benefit of cloud. Users can access whenever and wherever. Users only need the Internet or 3G to get access in cloud server. Users can add more storage or capacity if they need. Data can also be backup on around 15 minutes. For example, Apple is using iCloud as a cloud server. If Apple users had loss their phones or Apple’s devices, they just need to buy a new one and then backup the data with iCloud account. The recovery time will be increased rather than using the USB or plugging to laptop or computer to backup the data.
As the Apple user, I figure out that there are several problems about cloud servers. It makes the users paid to use it. If users want to use it more effectively with more spaces, they need to pay for more spaces. In my opinion, I had experienced cloud server for many years. There are two things that I do not like about cloud server which are functioning ways and monthly payment. Uploading function of cloud is one of worst things. It took me a lot of times to upload files. Monthly payment makes me sick of it however it brings me lots of benefit. </p>

<p>Blockchain is, in essence, a technology for information and data storage. Blockchain is the perfect combination of transparency and security because it allows people to know others' transaction information but the private data of each individual is still ensured absolute confidentiality. Once the information or data are stored in the blockchain, no one can change and there is no way to remove it. Blockchain will exist forever literally, this is the most important determinant that the world will trust and use this technology. The most typical application of blockchain is the cryptocurrency which has made the world technology changes rapidly in recent 10 years. Many people have changed their lives thanks to virtual money and also a lot of people went bankrupt because of the wrong investment but the most remarkable is many countries in the world are developing their economy very fast after applying cryptocurrency into the market. According to my personal prediction, in the next 3 years, many nations will apply blockchain into many kinds of fields such as medical, education, finance, logistics and so on. The main reason why this technology is useful is because of its easy application and security. To be more specific, blockchain now has 3 innovations, the first blockchain version (blockchain 1.0) is cryptocurrencies. In the second version (blockchain 2.0), this technology allows some applications that relate to finance such as smart contracts which is the automation of the agreement of exchange. Version 3.0 is the most modern version that blockchain can apply in most of the fields named military, education, medical and law... Besides, the paradigm of Distributed Network and Ledger makes information can't be hacked because it doesn't have to use the centralized network method that a lot of banks have been hacked and lost both money and information. Those are why every bank in the world are using this technology to ensure their system.

Nowadays, many people are confusing between blockchain and Bitcoin, some people think those are one. In fact, blockchain is a technology and Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies are built on the foundation of this technology. Cryptocurrencies literally mean virtual money that everyone can use through the Internet. In recent years, the definition of cryptocurrency has gradually grown in popularity with the crowd in Vietnam and all over the world. The most popular name of it is Bitcoin which is the most valuable currency in the world, 1 Bitcoin equal to about 12.000 USD, it used to be more expensive. Besides Bitcoin, there are hundreds of other cryptocurrencies included Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero, Ripple and so on. Not only the cryptocurrencies can use the blockchain but now most of the banks in the world have been applied this technology to secure the customer's information and their transaction. Because of the value of Bitcoin, it has become a trading item in many communities. Also, with the help of blockchain, fund transferring and trading became available to do online using the internet securely. Within 3 years we think that Cryptocurrencies will be accepted in every online shop and even can be used in normal payment with the help of some apps. Speaking of apps, the whole technology needs to have software to run and to use it everywhere it required a big network and server.
There are a lot of applications of blockchain that changed the way the world work. Most noticeable are the cryptocurrencies, smart contracts and the security system of banks. To be more specific, a lot of nations in the world are using Bitcoin and many other kinds of cryptocurrencies as an official and legal currency and Bitcoin also helps to develop their economy dramatically. In fact, many people have changed their lives due to cryptocurrencies, they invested and traded with an incredible profit. But on the contrary, also a lot of people go bankrupt because of the wrong investment.
Besides cryptocurrencies, blockchain can be applied in smart contracts effectively. When the two sides of partners want to sign a contract with clear and specific terms, they can install a built-in programming code into the block rely on the scripts ITTT stand for If This Then That. Once the conditions are satisfied, the signing will be executed automatically without a guarantee of any intermediary.
Thanks to blockchain's transparency, clarity, and security, this technology will be used in many fields that can solve many security, privacy, and convenience issues. We can see most clearly in medical, education, election, e-commerce, logistics, and finance... Among which, blockchain can solve the issue of storing and sharing the medical record of every patient. So when patient transferring happens, every hospital can have the profile and medical record of patients quickly and accurately without redo many tests like blood tests that very waste time and money. Blockchain can make transparent transcripts and profiles of students from primary to university and especially is this technology can manage the scores of candidates in national examinations that no one can edit it. Blockchain can ensure customers have peace of mind that they are buying the real products thanks to traceability. Moreover, this technology would help cut operating expenses, reduce the cost of transport management, and minimize capital losses in logistics.

Soon, when this advanced technology be applied in every field of life, people's information will be more secure and they will have a better life due to the convenience of this technology. For instance, I don't have to do the blood tests again after transfer to another hospital because the information of my tests will be shared between different hospitals transparently and accurately. Moreover, the transaction information of me and my family will be safe and we don't have to care about the security of information anymore.

<h2>Industry Data </h2>
  <p>Khoi and Duc have the same ideal position which is full stack developer and this rank 17th in the rate of demand. For the job, they need to know how to use most of popular programming languages and techniques, especially Java, Python and C++. And, for the general skills, they need to have such skills as problem solving, creativity, multi-tasking, English and maybe communication skills. All of these skills rank slatternly on both IT skills and general skills charts of demand. Java and JavaScript rank 2nd and 3rd; Python is located at 22nd; the last program is C++ but we cannot see it on the chart. There are other high demand skills too like Building relationships, Project management and Business management but we do not think they will need those anytime soon. In addition, they chose this type of job since the beginning, even after seeing the Burning Glass data, they still have not changed their mind yet because now they know that this job demand is plenty enough. </p>
  <h3> Machine Learning </h3>
  <p>Machine learning is the closest technology to real Artificial Intelligence (AI)  that is exiting nowadays. It is the concept of computer learning and storing information throughout the time, the longer we use it the smarter it becomes. In other words, it is a technology that helps computers improve throughout the time, that it is being used, automatically. It can learn the user’s habit and build up a storage of data so that it can reply back to the user the way that they usually need. Even during doing that, if the user changes something or adds more tasks, the computer will learn it for the future. So basically, because the ability to learn from experience like a human, everyone says it is the closest thing to real AI.</p>
  <p>Advertisement companies depend a lot on the machine learning technology, the websites checks the user cookie, studies the user's past searches and finds out their habit so that can suggest an advert that may please the users. Even our recent electronic devices use this technology too. For example autocorrect and auto word fill, they use it to detect our most used words and what we normally text and suggest the word for us. Smartphones can also use machine learning for the face and fingerprint identification, the first few scans cannot recognize the use but the more we use the more it learns about our face structure and fingerprint so that later the scan will become more accurate.</p>
  <p>Because of the similarity to real AI, machine learning will have that most important role when it becomes an actual thing. Human intelligence has the same concept, we all build up our knowledge from experience which we did, read or were told. In the future, machine learning can upgrade to something like they can find the information by themself without a human involved. And when it evolves to AI technology, it will be able to detect and solve problems by themselves. However, we think the most likely thing that can happen after 3 years is the automatic shared experience between multiple different computers. Because now we are able to store information on the internet with a user account, it will be likely to connect the machine learning technology of multiple devices. </p>
  <p>To make this potential future come true, first of all we need to focus on developing from the core which is the information processing unit. By upgrading this part first, the brain of the computer can handle multiple information and work through it really quick like a real human. Next thing we should consider must be the storage capacity of the data that the computer adds to the system everyday. To be run as an artificial intelligence, computers need to store new information every second but can still keep and use the old one when needed. The final technology which can help make space for the storage and improve the speed of processing is the system can detect unnecessary data. By disposing of those types of data, it will free a lot of junk information in the storage. Furthermore, the computer will be able to scan for the information quicker because there is less data to check.</p>
  <p>First thing that this technology will change is employment. A lot of jobs will be replaced with robots which have AI and connect with the network of the company server. This happened because a computer will work more effectively and certainly than a real human. Additionally, the job will be done faster because now there aren’t any humans as a third party to do the job, every paperwork and data will be analysed and then uploaded to the main server of the company immediately by computer. All of this means that unemployment will increase in the future because a lot of jobs will be replaced by computers and AI. Let take YouTube as an example, they now use machine learning instead of workers like before to process the new videos that creators uploaded. If YouTube already uses it that means the more machine learning gets advanced, the more companies will use it. A lot of people may lose their jobs.</p>
  <p>I use machine learning a lot, especially if i have to write something because it helps me increase my writing pace. If I type out an essay on Google Doc, the site uses machine learning to detect my most written phases for the next time. By that, later in the essay, if it sees familiar first few characters it can recommend the phase that I want to use and with a press of a button, it will automatically fill in. Another application of machine learning is Alexa from Amazon Echo which I use a lot. At the first few times, I needed to use a long and detailed command so that she could accurately understand my demands. However, the more I command her the more she gets advanced, so now I only use short sentences or even just a word or phase. <p>

<h3>Dialog</h3>
<p>Duc: Alright Mr.Bao, Thanks for sitting down with me for a couple of minutes. In this interview, I will try to ask you some questions about the IT work and I will try to learn as much from you as possible. As far as I know, you've graduated from RMIT University in an IT bachelor, so can you please tell me about your IT work? What exactly do you do now?

<br>IT professional: As you have known before that I've graduated from RMIT 3 years ago and right now I'm working as an IOS developer for a start-up company in the online dating industry. </br>

<br>Duc: And about the industry you work in?</br>

<br>IT professional: Basically, the IT industry is quite an important industry right now because any other industry can relate to IT in one way or another. The online dating industry is no exception like we have websites, mobile applications that can help people find the right one on the internet because, in the modern world, you don't have enough time to go out and meet new people so you will go to the dating website and dating applications to find the one that shares the interest will you to their profile and send them a message or go out with them. In the happy cases, it can lead to a relationship or even marriage and in bad cases, you get to know a new person so one way and another, it's all good.</br>

<br>Duc: Are there any other kinds of work do you have to do in your company?</br>

<br>IT professional: Because we are a start-up and members in a start-up have to wear a lot of hats. We have to do a lot of roles cause we don't have enough people and my main task is to maintain, fix and improve our IOS app, but also I have to know about UI, UX, a little bit web server, testing. I have to do all of those works because we don't have enough time and resources to hide more people, I just don't have to do it if it's not related to IOS.</br>

<br>Duc: And about people. Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Are they other IT professionals? Investors or clients?</br>

<br>IT professional: Yes, I have to communicate a lot with IT professionals like the guys from other departments, we have IOS, Android, servers, system admins and the tester to deliver the best performance. And about the clients or investors, we are a product company, not an outsourcing company so we don't have clients, we work for ourselves. That why we don't have to communicate with the clients.</br>

<br>Duc: So specifically, please tell me about your interactions with other IT professionals.</br>

<br> IT professional: For example with Android, we have to communicate with the Android team even IOS and Android are two different operating systems but the apps have to behave the same so we have to make sure that things will happen. And about the server like any other system, the server and system admin are very important so they're also the guys that I have to communicate the most. About the investor, our investor is also our product owner, we have to communicate with him about the plan, about what the product will look like and what will we do next. For example, if he wants to make a new feature but we still have a lot of performance issues and if we don't fix them right away the app will crash or behave badly so we have to fix them right away before making anything new. That's why we have to explain to him and he is the guy that has to make the decision. So we have to communicate a lot with the investors. There are also a lot of cases that we have to decide between A or B and we cannot decide it ourselves because it involves the business so we have to talk to him and let him decide what will be the best for our product.
</br>

<br>Duc: What aspects of your work do you spend most time on?</br>

<br>IT professional: Just like most of the software developers, we have to read the code a lot. More specifically, our codebase is pretty big because it went through a lot of versions so sometimes we have to run along or chase the business, we have to release our product as soon as possible cause the codebase is really bad. There are classes and functions that don't follow any coding conventions so reading the codebase is the way that I can find and fix to improve the performance. And I also monitor the crashlytic situation on the production, we have a tool that can track if are there any crashes happen on the production, we have to monitor it daily and fix them right away if there is anything bad happen.</br>

<br>Duc: About the difficulties, which aspect of your work do you find the most challenging?</br>

<br>IT professional: The most interesting thing is also the most challenging that I found is to come up with the solution that is better than the old one like we usually have a struggle, architecture or solution that just work ok which lead to the performance is not good, not bad so we usually have to come up with something that better than the old one and we have to make sure that deliver better performance with no bug so it's will have to run smoothly.</br>

<br>Duc: So that means you have to improve your app every day?</br>

<br>IT professional: Basically it every day, sometimes involved in a lot of departments for example like we have to communicate with the server, Android and maybe also the designers to come up with the solution and the communication happens every day.</br>

<br>Duc: Finally, can you share an example of your work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</br>

<br>IT professional: The aim of the IT industry is to make the world a better place, to improve people's lives and to solve people's problems. The online dating industry is to solve the dating problem of people , we have received a lot of emails from couples. They said that they met each other through our app and website and later on they got married so they sent emails to thanks for our work. That makes us really proud and it makes me feel like our work matters, it's help people in some way and that's what keeps us going and motivating every day.</br> </p>
