  <h2 style="color:blue">IT Techonology</h2>
  <h3>Khang</h3>
  <p>Nowadays, the tech industry has grown massively. With technology, our world redefined, our life has become easier and more convenient with the help of technology. But all of the data, user information of each company have, hardware and software can be threatened by malware and spyware, hacker, password attack,... Another part is because technology has become a crucial part of our lives, we are surrounded by tech devices such as TV, smartphones, computers,... It is normal to see a person using their smartphone, or computer out on the street, in the corner of a coffee shop, on the bus to surfing the net, take a look at their online social account, watching the news, movies, or play video games. Because of the usage of the internet, people also care about how each company protects user information, how secure does that information is protected. That is where cybersecurity steps in as a wall to prevent, protect all of the sensitive information from the threats above happened. Cybersecurity is the protection of anything related to the information in the technology field such as hardware, software, user password key, secret data from cyber threats, malware, spyware, and many reasons more. For example, all of the steps that you have to do to buying stuff online is input your account, input an SMS code, or using two-factor authentication are pretty complicated but it prevents bad guys from knowing what is your bank account to steal your money or knowing your information about you such as your home address, bank account,... In the tech industry, in the past, Apple has refused to unlock the phone of a criminal because even they can not open their own product, although they have refused to give the FBI the backdoor of the operating system of a phone because that is violating the company policy. What I have seen is they have successfully created for their phone a high-security encrypting data mechanism that makes the FBI have to spend millions of dollars to crack open, hack, go through a firewall of the software, the operating system for further investigation about that criminal information. I think after that incident happens, we can see that Apple has proved how they care about the data, the user information, personal privacy. Now in Viet Nam, according to cybermap.kaspersky.com, VietNam ranked 7th of the most attacked country in the world. Hackers from all over the world can easily hack into Viet Nam system for their own purpose, without the owner or the developers of the system know that they are in their own system. This is the problem that we are facing and need to solve it by training more people or cooperate with international companies about exchange workers in this field. Another idea is to hire some experts in this field to help our country have better security in our cyber world. In the future, because of the technology change, cybersecurity developers will become one of the hottest jobs for people to assign in that position. To make that job, or you can say to make VietNam become more secure in the cyber world, now we have to spend money and time to develop a new generation have deep knowledge about cybersecurity, also invest in finding experts in cybersecurity field to improve our security, to create a better mechanism for protecting information, important data of our country.</p>

  <p>Cybersecurity can have a huge change not only in our normal life but also in the way that people usually behave. With a more secure network, app, account management, users do not have to worried about are they being attacked, collected sensitive information. Also, people’s life will become less stressful, happier when you don’t have to worry about all of the information leaks. This will create a huge change in people’s awareness of securing personal information and how to deal with it when they are under attack or being stolen personal information. Everyone will become more cautious about giving their own information for a third company or online because they have known about not only the bright side of the internet but also the dark side of it. For example, if you have knowledge about how dangerous the internet, or the cyber world will have, you will know how to protect your information. When an app in your phone asking you for it to collect your location, your information, you will be more considerate to turn it off or not to grant access for it. Does not like in the past, you just only click okay or agree for it to have access to your personal information to do whatever the developers of that app to do whatever they want. I think in the future, this will create a lot of jobs for people specifically in VietNam because right now, Viet Nam is still a developing country, we still don’t have resources and human resources in many fields such as clouds, cybersecurity,... the protection of the personal information in Viet Nam is still in developing process but it plays an important role in each company, enterprise, even the whole country need it to make Viet Nam become a developed country</p>

  <p>To me, if I have cybersecurity will affect the way I use my online social account, the way I think about a person, or some webpage ask me about my information for its research or purposes. I think this is normal because as a normal person, for example, you don’t want to show your ID to strangers because you don’t know are they good or not, and you also don’t know what they will use your ID for good or bad. That is one of the good behavior that I think everyone should have. Some companies will change their policy in order to make the user experience become more secure, create a better trust of customers. In a result, there will be a more complicated process, more steps for better security when the user wants to login to their account. This will make the customer, the user who owns a bank account, their own social account to feel a bit angry because there are too many steps to login, although that will help their account to be more secure in front of the hackers, attacks of bad guys want to steal your information. To me, because in my family, my parents are an old people, they often feel hard to push themself to adapt to changes. I think it will take time for the old people to learn how does the system, mechanism work, and have time to mastered how to use it. But to my friends that at the same age, we are receiving new change and can adapt to that new change easily. We can learn how to operate it fluently, using it like a professional in just after a few hours to get used to that interface. It will not be a big problem if the security in Viet Nam has improvements on our internet, webpage security in the future.

  <p><br>Blockchain is, in essence, a technology for information and data storage. Blockchain is the perfect combination of transparency and security because it allows people to know others' transaction information but the private data of each individual is still ensured absolute confidentiality. Once the information or data are stored in the blockchain, no one can change and there is no way to remove it. Blockchain will exist forever literally, this is the most important determinant that the world will trust and use this technology. The most typical application of blockchain is the cryptocurrency which has made the world technology changes rapidly in recent 10 years. Many people have changed their lives thanks to virtual money and also a lot of people went bankrupt because of the wrong investment but the most remarkable is many countries in the world are developing their economy very fast after applying cryptocurrency into the market. According to my personal prediction, in the next 3 years, many nations will apply blockchain into many kinds of fields such as medical, education, finance, logistics and so on. The main reason why this technology is useful is because of its easy application and security. To be more specific, blockchain now has 3 innovations, the first blockchain version (blockchain 1.0) is cryptocurrencies. In the second version (blockchain 2.0), this technology allows some applications that relate to finance such as smart contracts which is the automation of the agreement of exchange. Version 3.0 is the most modern version that blockchain can apply in most of the fields named military, education, medical and law... Besides, the paradigm of Distributed Network and Ledger makes information can't be hacked because it doesn't have to use the centralized network method that a lot of banks have been hacked and lost both money and information. Those are why every bank in the world are using this technology to ensure their system.
  </br>

  <br>Nowadays, many people are confusing between blockchain and Bitcoin, some people think those are one. In fact, blockchain is a technology and Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies are built on the foundation of this technology. Cryptocurrencies literally mean virtual money that everyone can use through the Internet. In recent years, the definition of cryptocurrency has gradually grown in popularity with the crowd in Vietnam and all over the world. The most popular name of it is Bitcoin which is the most valuable currency in the world, 1 Bitcoin equal to about 12.000 USD, it used to be more expensive. Besides Bitcoin, there are hundreds of other cryptocurrencies included Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero, Ripple and so on. Not only the cryptocurrencies can use the blockchain but now most of the banks in the world have been applied this technology to secure the customer's information and their transaction. Because of the value of Bitcoin, it has become a trading item in many communities. Also, with the help of blockchain, fund transferring and trading became available to do online using the internet securely. Within 3 years we think that Cryptocurrencies will be accepted in every online shop and even can be used in normal payment with the help of some apps. Speaking of apps, the whole technology needs to have software to run and to use it everywhere it required a big network and server.
  There are a lot of applications of blockchain that changed the way the world work. Most noticeable are the cryptocurrencies, smart contracts and the security system of banks. To be more specific, a lot of nations in the world are using Bitcoin and many other kinds of cryptocurrencies as an official and legal currency and Bitcoin also helps to develop their economy dramatically. In fact, many people have changed their lives due to cryptocurrencies, they invested and traded with an incredible profit. But on the contrary, also a lot of people go bankrupt because of the wrong investment.</br>
  <br>Besides cryptocurrencies, blockchain can be applied in smart contracts effectively. When the two sides of partners want to sign a contract with clear and specific terms, they can install a built-in programming code into the block rely on the scripts ITTT stand for If This Then That. Once the conditions are satisfied, the signing will be executed automatically without a guarantee of any intermediary.</br>
  <br>Thanks to blockchain's transparency, clarity, and security, this technology will be used in many fields that can solve many security, privacy, and convenience issues. We can see most clearly in medical, education, election, e-commerce, logistics, and finance... Among which, blockchain can solve the issue of storing and sharing the medical record of every patient. So when patient transferring happens, every hospital can have the profile and medical record of patients quickly and accurately without redo many tests like blood tests that very waste time and money. Blockchain can make transparent transcripts and profiles of students from primary to university and especially is this technology can manage the scores of candidates in national examinations that no one can edit it. Blockchain can ensure customers have peace of mind that they are buying the real products thanks to traceability. Moreover, this technology would help cut operating expenses, reduce the cost of transport management, and minimize capital losses in logistics.
</br>

  <br>Soon, when this advanced technology be applied in every field of life, people's information will be more secure and they will have a better life due to the convenience of this technology. For instance, I don't have to do the blood tests again after transfer to another hospital because the information of my tests will be shared between different hospitals transparently and accurately. Moreover, the transaction information of me and my family will be safe and we don't have to care about the security of information anymore.</br>

<h3> Machine Learning </h3>
<p>Machine learning is the closest technology to real Artificial Intelligence (AI)  that is exiting nowadays. It is the concept of computer learning and storing information throughout the time, the longer we use it the smarter it becomes. In other words, it is a technology that helps computers improve throughout the time, that it is being used, automatically. It can learn the user’s habit and build up a storage of data so that it can reply back to the user the way that they usually need. Even during doing that, if the user changes something or adds more tasks, the computer will learn it for the future. So basically, because the ability to learn from experience like a human, everyone says it is the closest thing to real AI.</p>
<p>Advertisement companies depend a lot on the machine learning technology, the websites checks the user cookie, studies the user's past searches and finds out their habit so that can suggest an advert that may please the users. Even our recent electronic devices use this technology too. For example autocorrect and auto word fill, they use it to detect our most used words and what we normally text and suggest the word for us. Smartphones can also use machine learning for the face and fingerprint identification, the first few scans cannot recognize the use but the more we use the more it learns about our face structure and fingerprint so that later the scan will become more accurate.</p>
<p>Because of the similarity to real AI, machine learning will have that most important role when it becomes an actual thing. Human intelligence has the same concept, we all build up our knowledge from experience which we did, read or were told. In the future, machine learning can upgrade to something like they can find the information by themself without a human involved. And when it evolves to AI technology, it will be able to detect and solve problems by themselves. However, we think the most likely thing that can happen after 3 years is the automatic shared experience between multiple different computers. Because now we are able to store information on the internet with a user account, it will be likely to connect the machine learning technology of multiple devices. </p>
<p>To make this potential future come true, first of all we need to focus on developing from the core which is the information processing unit. By upgrading this part first, the brain of the computer can handle multiple information and work through it really quick like a real human. Next thing we should consider must be the storage capacity of the data that the computer adds to the system everyday. To be run as an artificial intelligence, computers need to store new information every second but can still keep and use the old one when needed. The final technology which can help make space for the storage and improve the speed of processing is the system can detect unnecessary data. By disposing of those types of data, it will free a lot of junk information in the storage. Furthermore, the computer will be able to scan for the information quicker because there is less data to check.</p>
<p>First thing that this technology will change is employment. A lot of jobs will be replaced with robots which have AI and connect with the network of the company server. This happened because a computer will work more effectively and certainly than a real human. Additionally, the job will be done faster because now there aren’t any humans as a third party to do the job, every paperwork and data will be analysed and then uploaded to the main server of the company immediately by computer. All of this means that unemployment will increase in the future because a lot of jobs will be replaced by computers and AI. Let take YouTube as an example, they now use machine learning instead of workers like before to process the new videos that creators uploaded. If YouTube already uses it that means the more machine learning gets advanced, the more companies will use it. A lot of people may lose their jobs.</p>
<p>I use machine learning a lot, especially if i have to write something because it helps me increase my writing pace. If he type out an essay on Google Doc, the site uses machine learning to detect my most written phases for the next time. By that, later in the essay, if it sees familiar first few characters it can recommend the phase that he want to use and with a press of a button, it will automatically fill in. Another application of machine learning is Alexa from Amazon Echo which I use a lot. At the first few times, I needed to use a long and detailed command so that she could accurately understand my demands. However, the more I command her the more she gets advanced, so now I only use short sentences or even just a word or phase. <p>
  <h3>Nick</h3>
  <p>In 4.0 era, there are many types of technology which work different from each other. There are Clouds, services, servers, Cybersecurity, Blockchain and cryptocurrencies, Machine Learning, Autonomous vehicles, Natural Language processing and chatterbots, Robots, and Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Makey Makeys, and other small computing devices. I have interested at Cloud, servers, Machine Learning, Autonomous vehicles, and Robots. Those four are main areas that I had seen and acknowledged it. People usually use their technology, but they never know the advance functions of their devices. There are many different function and benefit of that four areas. I am interested at Cloud servers the most in those four areas.
  First, what is Cloud? What does it do? Cloud can basically understand as the servers that connected to internet and software and application could be leased as a part by Cloud through the Internet. Cloud server is the server that run virtual area by technology environment. It is functioned through cloud computing platform through the network, and it can be accessed remotely.  According to <a href="https://www.ijcsi.org/papers/IJCSI-9-1-1-201-207.pdf">https://www.ijcsi.org/papers/IJCSI-9-1-1-201-207.pdf</a>, it is the state-of-the-art implementations of cloud computing is presented. For examples, Google Drive and Apple iCloud are popular in cloud server area. Google and Apple company had done an excellent job. The users are getting comfortable in using cloud to store their personal things. In 4.0 era, technology is developing rapidly with non-stop ratio. New phones, devices, computers, laptops, and applications is updating every single day. According to J.Clement, the record is about more than 100 applications released in google play per month in 2020 and the previous year. By the record, people can know that cloud server area is developing in positive way. It gets closed to users, easy to use, and brings lots of benefits by its functions. There are two types of cloud computing such as Location of the cloud computing and Type of services offered. Location of cloud computing has four types of cloud. Public cloud is hosted by cloud vendor and the users had no visibility and control it. Private cloud can be hosted by the users and it is private. The other users can not access to difference cloud server.  Hybrid cloud can be understood basically as the comparison of public cloud and private cloud. Finally, Community cloud can be shared between organization in the same community. Nowadays, people are connecting everything and application with cloud server or computing. In near future, cloud servers will increase the storage capacity, update the performance of internet and improvement of cloud servers. The improvement of cloud servers will mostly depend on the development of technology and technology company. The simplest examples are yahoo, email, outlook. Yahoo is old style of cloud server. Email and outlook are the improvement of cloud servers. My prediction about cloud servers in cloud is people will access to cloud by their own voice and fingerprint. Nowadays, people access to cloud server by user’s name or email and password which is complicated and easy to forget the user’s name or email and password. Fingerprint and voice are more safety and easy to log in. In the current, some of smartphone and bank had allowed the user to log in by face id and fingerprint but it need to connect to the saved passwords on the devices. For example, I had to save my password to my phone so that I can use face id to log in to iCloud in the anytime I need. It is convenient but face id is not working well enough. My prediction is voice password will replace face id which is hard to copy and easy to identify.
  What is Cloud server’s benefits? Cloud servers are individual which mean the other cloud serves cannot access or impact to your cloud servers without permission. Cloud is stability, safe, and high secure. It is fast and can avoided the hardware issue that impacted in physical. Adding memory and disk space is got easier by cloud servers. Users are affair about lying while they are doing online payment. Sometimes, the users will be lie by the seller. In cloud environment, users will pay for what they use monthly. There is one more benefit of cloud. Users can access whenever and wherever. Users only need the Internet or 3G to get access in cloud server. Users can add more storage or capacity if they need. Data can also be backup on around 15 minutes. For example, Apple is using iCloud as a cloud server. If Apple users had loss their phones or Apple’s devices, they just need to buy a new one and then backup the data with iCloud account. The recovery time will be increased rather than using the USB or plugging to laptop or computer to backup the data.
  As the Apple user, I figure out that there are several problems about cloud servers. It makes the users paid to use it. If users want to use it more effectively with more spaces, they need to pay for more spaces. In my opinion, I had experienced cloud server for many years. There are two things that I do not like about cloud server which are functioning ways and monthly payment. Uploading function of cloud is one of worst things. It took me a lot of times to upload files. Monthly payment makes me sick of it however it brings me lots of benefit. </p>

  <h2>Khang's IT industry</h2>
  <p>My job is placed in the system administrator section according to Burning Glass International inc. That job requires me to have a knowledge of Java Script, project management, and Python to be in that position. The most important skill is using Python fluently because as an administrator, you have to know how to create software. If you can use python smoothly, it is easier for you to write a normal software. The other skills are Project management and Java Script is also important, all of the three combines will help administrator to know more about working and manage a group when they have to work in a group, a part of a company. Regarding genetic skills, I think that as a system administrator, you have to have communication skills, collaboration, problem-solving, and planning to create a good workflow. Standing in the first place is communication skill because as a system adiministratoryou have to talk and have conversations to your company workers about the work that the whole group is working on. Followed by problem-solving skills. Coming up next although the system administrator does not require to have collaboration and planning, and leadership, team building, and the last one is English, it is good to have all of that skill if you want to have a better promotion opportunity at work.

<h2>Industry Data </h2>
<h3>Khoi and Duc </h3>
  <p>Khoi and Duc have the same ideal position which is full stack developer and this rank 17th in the rate of demand. For the job, they need to know how to use most of popular programming languages and techniques, especially Java, Python and C++. And, for the general skills, they need to have such skills as problem solving, creativity, multi-tasking, English and maybe communication skills. All of these skills rank slatternly on both IT skills and general skills charts of demand. Java and JavaScript rank 2nd and 3rd; Python is located at 22nd; the last program is C++ but we cannot see it on the chart. There are other high demand skills too like Building relationships, Project management and Business management but we do not think they will need those anytime soon. In addition, they chose this type of job since the beginning, even after seeing the Burning Glass data, they still have not changed their mind yet because now they know that this job demand is plenty enough. </p>

<h3>Dialog</h3>

<p><br>Duc: Alright Mr.Bao, Thanks for sitting down with me for a couple of minutes. In this interview, I will try to ask you some questions about the IT work and I will try to learn as much from you as possible. As far as I know, you've graduated from RMIT University in an IT bachelor, so can you please tell me about your IT work? What exactly do you do now?
</br>

<br>IT professional: As you have known before that I've graduated from RMIT 3 years ago and right now I'm working as an IOS developer for a start-up company in the online dating industry. </br>

<br>Duc: And about the industry you work in?</br>

<br>IT professional: Basically, the IT industry is quite an important industry right now because any other industry can relate to IT in one way or another. The online dating industry is no exception like we have websites, mobile applications that can help people find the right one on the internet because, in the modern world, you don't have enough time to go out and meet new people so you will go to the dating website and dating applications to find the one that shares the interest will you to their profile and send them a message or go out with them. In the happy cases, it can lead to a relationship or even marriage and in bad cases, you get to know a new person so one way and another, it's all good.</br>

<br>Duc: Are there any other kinds of work do you have to do in your company?</br>

<br>IT professional: Because we are a start-up and members in a start-up have to wear a lot of hats. We have to do a lot of roles cause we don't have enough people and my main task is to maintain, fix and improve our IOS app, but also I have to know about UI, UX, a little bit web server, testing. I have to do all of those works because we don't have enough time and resources to hide more people, I just don't have to do it if it's not related to IOS.</br>

<br>Duc: And about people. Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Are they other IT professionals? Investors or clients?</br>

<br>IT professional: Yes, I have to communicate a lot with IT professionals like the guys from other departments, we have IOS, Android, servers, system admins and the tester to deliver the best performance. And about the clients or investors, we are a product company, not an outsourcing company so we don't have clients, we work for ourselves. That why we don't have to communicate with the clients.</br>

<br>Duc: So specifically, please tell me about your interactions with other IT professionals.</br>

<br> IT professional: For example with Android, we have to communicate with the Android team even IOS and Android are two different operating systems but the apps have to behave the same so we have to make sure that things will happen. And about the server like any other system, the server and system admin are very important so they're also the guys that I have to communicate the most. About the investor, our investor is also our product owner, we have to communicate with him about the plan, about what the product will look like and what will we do next. For example, if he wants to make a new feature but we still have a lot of performance issues and if we don't fix them right away the app will crash or behave badly so we have to fix them right away before making anything new. That's why we have to explain to him and he is the guy that has to make the decision. So we have to communicate a lot with the investors. There are also a lot of cases that we have to decide between A or B and we cannot decide it ourselves because it involves the business so we have to talk to him and let him decide what will be the best for our product.
</br>

<br>Duc: What aspects of your work do you spend most time on?</br>

<br>IT professional: Just like most of the software developers, we have to read the code a lot. More specifically, our codebase is pretty big because it went through a lot of versions so sometimes we have to run along or chase the business, we have to release our product as soon as possible cause the codebase is really bad. There are classes and functions that don't follow any coding conventions so reading the codebase is the way that I can find and fix to improve the performance. And I also monitor the crashlytic situation on the production, we have a tool that can track if are there any crashes happen on the production, we have to monitor it daily and fix them right away if there is anything bad happen.</br>

<br>Duc: About the difficulties, which aspect of your work do you find the most challenging?</br>

<br>IT professional: The most interesting thing is also the most challenging that I found is to come up with the solution that is better than the old one like we usually have a struggle, architecture or solution that just work ok which lead to the performance is not good, not bad so we usually have to come up with something that better than the old one and we have to make sure that deliver better performance with no bug so it's will have to run smoothly.</br>

<br>Duc: So that means you have to improve your app every day?</br>

<br>IT professional: Basically it every day, sometimes involved in a lot of departments for example like we have to communicate with the server, Android and maybe also the designers to come up with the solution and the communication happens every day.</br>

<br>Duc: Finally, can you share an example of your work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</br>

<br>IT professional: The aim of the IT industry is to make the world a better place, to improve people's lives and to solve people's problems. The online dating industry is to solve the dating problem of people , we have received a lot of emails from couples. They said that they met each other through our app and website and later on they got married so they sent emails to thanks for our work. That makes us really proud and it makes me feel like our work matters, it's help people in some way and that's what keeps us going and motivating every day.</br> </p>

<h2 style="color:blue" >Project idea</h2>

  <p>We chose to make a smart helmet which is a hi-tech armour piece protecting our head on the road. In this project we will find a way to fit multiple modern components and a mini computer inside a full face covered helmet and program a system to convert it into advanced electronic devices. However, to make such an advanced helmet, we need to invest a lot of time, afford and money, maybe thousands of dollars. Also we may need to find some other experts to help us too.</p>
  <P>What is the helmet? Helmet is the hat that people wear while they are driving to protect their head. Why should we need to have a smart helmet? What are the advantages of the smart helmet? People are using earphones and airpods to listen to music and answer phone calls while they are driving. The police sometimes will make you paid if you are driving with earphones on. The advantages of a smart helmet are turn on music without your phone outed, answering phone calls, no ropes, and protecting your head. People need to have a smart helmet for not to pay unreasonable purposes and enjoy their hobbies.</P>
  <p>What will the smart helmet look like? The smart helmet will look like the motorbike helmet which will fully cover the user's head. What is special about a smart helmet? Smart helmet contains all of the functions that drivers need while they are driving. It has Bluetooth Operation panel, speaker, upper and downward ventilation system, and many useful functions. People can imagine how amazing is the helmet that can connect to your phone by the Bluetooth Operation system. Drivers can listen to music, answer phone calls while they are driving. The ventilation system will make users feel comfortable while they are driving. The user will not feel hot or mad with the sunshine or hot wind of the summer. The smart helmet also has a windshield to protect the user's face, and also doubles as a screen for the user to look at the google maps. To display an image on the windshield, we use a micro projector, similar to new projecting meter technology inside a modern car. Furthermore, on the forehead area there will be a built in dash cam to record user journey for evidence if there is an acidence, we can extract the video on the mobile app. The helmet will also contain two microphones, one is on the outside and other is inside the helmet.  The outside one is for the safety purpose. Because the fully covered helmet kind of muffle the road noise, we may not be able to hear the upcoming vehicles. The microphone will capture the noise and mimic it through a surround headphone inside the helmet. The inside one will be the heart of the system because it will take the user’s voice command and also the microphone that the user will use for answering the phone call. Speaking of the voice command, the user will control every function of the helmet by voice command with the help of built-in Google Assistant AI. There are two ways to charge the helmet, the first way is kind of mundane which just plugs it in the outlet, and the second way is using the sun through the solar power on top of the helmet. Our most proud part of the helmet is the user interface which is applied with Google technology. The Google Assistant is used for taking and answering the commend, If the user needs to use GPS, there is Google Maps. In addition, the user can even update with daily news by the News app of Google. </p>

We may work on multiple versions depending on the user's purpose but for now the main priority is for the Vietnamese motorbike drivers.</p>

People are using earphones and airpods to listen to music and answer phone calls while they are driving. The police sometimes will make you paid if you are driving with earphones on. The advantages of a smart helmet are turn on music without your phone outed, answering phone calls, no wire, and protecting your head. Because of the function that lets the user listen to music but still keep their awareness on the road, it will be allowed to be worn when we are driving in Vietnam. </P>

There are three ways to charge the helmet, the first way is kind of mundane which just plugs it in the outlet, and the second way is using the sun through the solar power on top of the helmet but our third solution is maybe the most effective way which is using a wind turbine. By having the wind turbine, we can still use it during the non-sunny day, and when we move the turbin will spin and create more electricity to charge the helmet too, it is a self-sufficient energy. Our most proud part of the helmet is the user interface which is applied with Google technology. The Google Assistant is used for taking and answering the commend, If the user needs to use GPS, there is Google Maps. In addition, the user can even update with daily news by the News app of Google.  All of this interface will be displayed using AR technology, it literally is an helmet attached to the Google Glasses.</p>

  <p>If this helmet becomes a thing, it will definitely help the driver keep their hand on the handlebar and their mind on the road but also bring entertainment for the driver. The driver now can listen to music and be able hear the surroundings very well at the same time; looking at the maps but still keeping their eye on the road. It will also help the user to save a bunch of time for getting updated with daily news because now they can even do that during  the commute.</p>

<h2 style="color:blue">Feedback</h2>
<p><li>Khoi:
He worked hard anh very creative in this assignment. He done his individual part on time. He is working well in group assignment, but he need to improve the confidence to mingle with everyone in the group.</li>

<li>Khang:
 His ability and the way of working is good but he always late in group meeting and individual works deadline. He should pay more attention to the deadline and work more responsible.</li>
<li>Duc is a diligent and hard-working person, he is always on time for both meetings and deadlines. However, that is also a weak side of him because sometimes he tried to take it all by himself and sometimes it make some members lazy.</li>
<li>Nick (Nam) has a lot of great ideas such as the bluetooth helmet which is the base concept of our new smart helmet project, he also never misses the deadlines. His bad side is that he is late for a few meetings.</li></p>

<h2 style="color:blue"> Group reflection </h2>
<li>I am Nam. My group is working well in separate work parts (individual part). We had created the deadline for our individual so that each member will complete their works on time.  In my point of view, I think that our groups can improve the ways of planning time. We are little bit rushing in current time. I was surprised that each individual part is done on time while we had a lot of deadlines in other classes. I had learned about how works be done if we are working in groups. I had got problems at the beginning of the project with Github. The problem is I cannot push my changes up to github but the other teammates can do it but problem was solved when we worked together.</li>

<li>I'm Duc, I've given the deadline for the individual part of all members that we discussed at first and everyone has done it perfectly with the exception of Khang for some personal reasons but after all, everything is ok. So I feel very happy and proud of my teammates, they're dynamic, creative and the most important is they responsible for their part.</li>

<li>My name is Khoi, I think in this group we work great together. There is hardly any controversy, at first we had an argument to choose between 2 projects that Professor Long said was a great idea, smart mirror from me and Nick’s bluetooth helmet. However, eventually it worked out well when we decided to combine the 2 ideas together. We also do not have any difficulties in using Github to collaborate either. It is a good experience  working in this group project.</li>
