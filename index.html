<p>Cryptocurrencies literally mean virtual money that everyone can use through the Internet. The most popular name of this technology is Bitcoin which is the most valuable currency in the world, 1 bitcoin equal to about 12.000 USD, it used to be more expensive. Blockchain allows the users to transfer or trade from network to another one. This also mean that everyone does not need to go to the bank to make transfer. Not only the cryptocurrencies can use the blockchain but now most of the banks in the world have been apply this technology to help the customers. Because of the value of Bitcoin, it has become a trading item in some communities. Also, with the help of blockchain, fund transferring and trading became available to do online using internet.
