<h3>Personal information</h3>
<p><br>Nick, ID number is s3804825, My national is Vietnam. I can spoke 2 languages which are Vietnammese and Enghlish. I am a person who always be friendly. Black coffee wihtout sugar is my favorite drink.I have a special feeling with the ball that I can't describe how strong and special is it. Football is my life. I always find the ball and practice myself when I have freetime. I loved to "destoying my laptop" and also find new thing in technology world. That's my IT interest. I have some soft skills and knowledge in open and repair devices.</br></p>

<p><br>His name is Khang.His ID number is s3824317. He is from Viet Nam. he is a first-year student of RMIT in IT major. he can speak Vietnamese and English.He loves to build a PC, optimizes it to make it better or take something apart and then put it all together, into its original form. He also plays Frisbee, because it is a fantastic sport where players can increase the strength health, keep fit better and have a happy time during they are playing. His interest in IT is about how to build a system like a PC, to combine different hardware together, make or create a software to compatible with as many hardware as possible. That interest starts from when He was 3-4 years-old. </br></p>

<p><br>He is Hoang Ngoc Anh Duc with the ID is s3818988. His hobbies are Gym, badminton, play game, listen to music. He has found that IT is one of the most important things is this 4.0 era and he can solve many problems if he good at this major. he started to like this major since he was 15 after watching a video from a Vietnamese guy making his AI called virtual assistant like Siri of Apple or Cortana of Microsoft. This Vietnamese guy got his master of AI certificate when he was 21 in Swinburne university and he also the lead tutor of AI in this school at the moment. And Duc was made my first virtual assistant by using his instruction without any knowledge about python.</br> </p>

<p>Last member of my team is Hoan Minh Khoi. His ID number is s3822041.He is from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. He can speak 2 languages Vietnamese and English. He like playing video games, in fact, when He was a high-schooler, during the summerbreak, He used to sit in front of the screen for 8-12 hours a day, sometimes He even reached 14-6 hours. He still love playing games but now 3-4 hours of screen time is my highest.The 2 aspect that He likes the most about IT are game industry and smart house setup.

<h2>Duc's Profile</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrencies literally mean virtual money that everyone can use through the Internet. The most popular name of this technology is Bitcoin which is the most valuable currency in the world, 1 bitcoin equal to about 12.000 USD, it used to be more expensive. Blockchain allows the users to transfer or trade from network to another one. This also mean that everyone does not need to go to the bank to make transfer. Not only the cryptocurrencies can use the blockchain but now most of the banks in the world have been apply this technology to help the customers. Because of the value of Bitcoin, it has become a trading item in some communities. Also, with the help of blockchain, fund transferring and trading became available to do online using internet. Within 3 years we think that Cryptocurrencies will be accepted in every online shop and even can be use in normal payment with the help of some apps. Speaking of apps, the whole technology needs to have software to run and to use it everywhere it required a big network and serve.

  <h2>Khoi's Profile</h2>
  <p>Khoi and Duc have the same ideal position which is full stack developer and this rank 17th in the rate of demand. For the job, they need to know how to use most of popular programming languages and techniques, especially Java, Python and C++. And, for the general skills, they need to have such skills as problem solving, creativity, multi-tasking, English and maybe communication skills. All of these skills rank slatternly on both IT skills and general skills charts of demand. Java and JavaScript rank 2nd and 3rd; Python is located at 22nd; the last program is C++ but we cannot see it on the chart. There are other high demand skills too like Building relationships, Project management and Business management but we do not think they will need those anytime soon. In addition, they chose this type of job since the beginning, even after seeing the Burning Glass data, they still have not changed their mind yet because now they know that this job demand is plenty enough. </p>
  <h3> Machine Learning </h3>
  <p>Machine learning is the closest technology to real Artificial Intelligence (AI)  that is exiting nowadays. It is the concept of computer learning and storing information throughout the time, the longer we use it the smarter it becomes. In other words, it is a technology that helps computers improve throughout the time, that it is being used, automatically. It can learn the userâ€™s habit and build up a storage of data so that it can reply back to the user the way that they usually need. Even during doing that, if the user changes something or adds more tasks, the computer will learn it for the future. So basically, because the ability to learn from experience like a human, everyone says it is the closest thing to real AI.</p>
  <p>Advertisement companies depend a lot on the machine learning technology, the websites checks the user cookie, studies the user's past searches and finds out their habit so that can suggest an advert that may please the users. Even our recent electronic devices use this technology too. For example autocorrect and auto word fill, they use it to detect our most used words and what we normally text and suggest the word for us. Smartphones can also use machine learning for the face and fingerprint identification, the first few scans cannot recognize the use but the more we use the more it learns about our face structure and fingerprint so that later the scan will become more accurate.</p>
  <p>Because of the similarity to real AI, machine learning will have that most important role when it becomes an actual thing. Human intelligence has the same concept, we all build up our knowledge from experience which we did, read or were told. In the future, machine learning can upgrade to something like they can find the information by themself without a human involved. And when it evolves to AI technology, it will be able to detect and solve problems by themselves. However, we think the most likely thing that can happen after 3 years is the automatic shared experience between multiple different computers. Because now we are able to store information on the internet with a user account, it will be likely to connect the machine learning technology of multiple devices. </p>
  <p>To make this potential future come true, first of all we need to focus on developing from the core which is the information processing unit. By upgrading this part first, the brain of the computer can handle multiple information and work through it really quick like a real human. Next thing we should consider must be the storage capacity of the data that the computer adds to the system everyday. To be run as an artificial intelligence, computers need to store new information every second but can still keep and use the old one when needed. The final technology which can help make space for the storage and improve the speed of processing is the system can detect unnecessary data. By disposing of those types of data, it will free a lot of junk information in the storage. Furthermore, the computer will be able to scan for the information quicker because there is less data to check. <p>
